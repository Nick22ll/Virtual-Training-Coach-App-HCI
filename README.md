# Virtual-Training-Coach-WebApp-HCI
A basic WebApp implementation of a Virtual Training Coach

## Why Virtual Training Coach? 
The WebApp Virtual Training Coach has been implemented to give support to those people who want to practise phisical exercises, both at home or at the gym, to evalute their correctness and to avoid wrong movements, which at worst can lead to injuries.
